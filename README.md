## git-xtree

Tiny script of mine to pretty-print the history tree, derived from some stuff in [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1057564/pretty-git-branch-graphs). Pulling into a separate repo to share.

To install, drop `git-xtree` in your `PATH`. Apologies for using `zsh` solely for `colors` :)

Example (calling `git xtree` from repo root):
